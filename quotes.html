"His greatest contribution was leading a Vision/Change Management process where I myself was the Client and we had to reinvent ourselves in light of changing market conditions. The net result of this project was a Customer endorsed point of difference that leveraged our core competency, and allowed us to regenerate double digit growth, leading to the successful sale of the business for a substantial premium relative to the market."
